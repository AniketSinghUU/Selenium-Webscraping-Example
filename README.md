# Selenium-Webscraping-Example

### Description
In this tutorial we will build a web scraping program that will scrape a Github user profile and get the Repository names and the Languages for the pinned repositories.

### Resources
We will leverage these Resources
* [Selenium](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium)
* [ChromeDriver - WebDriver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
* [Selenium-Python ReadTheDocs](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)


## We will also use the following packages and driver.
*•	selenium package — used to automate web browser interaction from Python
*•	ChromeDriver — provides a platform to launch and perform tasks in specified browser.
*•	Virtualenv — to create an isolated Python environment for our project.
*•	Extras: Selenium-Python ReadTheDocs Resource.


## Sequence
### *•	1st import: Allows you to launch/initialise a browser.

### *•	2nd import: Allows you to search for things using specific parameters.

### *•	3rd import: Allows you to wait for a page to load.

### *•	4th import: Specify what you are looking for on a specific page in order to determine that the webpage has loaded.

### *•	5th import: Handling a timeout situation.
